I am delighted to announce that I have completed my academic year by presenting my final project, "Design and Development of a Web/Mobile Application for Restaurant Delivery Management."

I had the opportunity to put my skills into practice during a 5-month internship at TuniAOS, where I could deepen my knowledge and contribute to exciting projects.

As a third-year computer science student specializing in information systems, I completed a 5-month internship project (2023-2024) with STE TUNIAOS S.A.R.L. I was passionate about computer science. Now, I have received my diploma.
